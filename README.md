# Screen Time

This is the first app I made with Remix.

The point of the app is to help parents optimize the TV shows that their children watch.

You can create a profile for your child and select the learning goals that they are currently working on.

The app will then suggest TV shows with a learning focus that fits your childs needs.

Will probably host at some point in the future. Still a work in progress.
